### Game of Life
This is the repository for the workshop "Programming 3" at [TUMO Center Berlin](https://tumo.de/berlin/).

The task for the final project was to create a server using Express that hosts a site. On the server, the simulation known as Game of Life should be running. Every time the simultaion updates, it'll be displayed for the connected user on the site. There, the user can trigger events for the simulation, eg. rain, that boosts Grass' growth.

**Note:** If you're a TUMO member, you shouldn't copy this code. It is part of the rules, to not use AI, copy code from the internet and help from other members during the workshop. You can look at the code after you finish the workshop yourself!

**Other Note:** There is a bug in the code but since I passed the workshop and have a lot to do, I won't be fixing it *for now*.
